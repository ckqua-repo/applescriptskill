# AppleScript Automation Skill

An [agent skill](https://agentskills.io/home) that enables AI coding assistants to automate native macOS applications using AppleScript. The agent dynamically generates AppleScript at runtime — there is no fixed action library.

Supported by 30+ agent products including Claude Code, VS Code/Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Goose, Roo Code, and more.

## Supported Applications

Reminders, Calendar, Notes, Mail, Finder, Notification Center, System Events, Clipboard, and any other scriptable Mac app.

The skill goes beyond plain AppleScript with a few additional capabilities:

- **HTML → PDF rendering** via Swift + WebKit. The agent generates HTML/CSS, and a compiled converter turns it into a multi-page PDF. See [pdf-generation.md](applescript/references/pdf-generation.md).
- **HTML → Mail draft** via the `«class HTML»` clipboard type. The agent generates HTML, AppleScript loads it onto the clipboard as rich HTML, and a Mail compose window receives it as styled rich text. See [html-email.md](applescript/references/html-email.md).
- **Fast Calendar / Reminders reads** via Swift + EventKit. AppleScript reads of these apps are slow; the Swift readers return results roughly 100x faster. See [scripts/calendar/](applescript/scripts/calendar/) and [scripts/reminders/](applescript/scripts/reminders/).

PDF generation and HTML email drafts are **distinct outputs** of the same HTML-authoring capability — pick the one that matches the user's goal (a document to share vs. a styled message to send).

## Requirements

- macOS (AppleScript is not available on other platforms)
- `osascript` (built-in on macOS)
- `sdef` (built-in on macOS, used for dictionary lookups)
- `swiftc` and `swift` (built-in via Command Line Tools, needed for PDF rendering and the Calendar/Reminders readers)

## Quick Install

The fastest way to install this skill is the one-liner `npx skills` command. It works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and 40+ other agent products — no manual copying, no path juggling. The CLI detects your environment and drops the skill in the right place.

CLI source: [github.com/vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)

```bash
# Global install — available across every project on your machine
npx skills add ckqbuilds/applescriptskill -g
```

```bash
# Project-level install — scoped to the current repository
npx skills add ckqbuilds/applescriptskill
```

```bash
# Agent-specific install — target a particular agent (e.g. claude-code, cursor, codex, copilot)
npx skills add ckqbuilds/applescriptskill -a claude-code
```

After the command finishes, skip to **Step 3: Verify it's working** below to confirm the install.

## Manual Installation

**Note:** The repository is named `applescriptskill`, but the installable skill is the `applescript/` subdirectory inside it. Copy that directory — not the repository root.

### Step 1: Add the skill to your project

Use **user-level** if you want the skill available across all your projects. Use **project-level** if you want it scoped to a single repo. When in doubt, start with user-level.

No dependencies to install. `osascript`, `sdef`, `swiftc`, and `swift` all ship with macOS / Command Line Tools.

```bash
# User-level (available in every project)
# Claude Code / Claude Desktop:
cp -r applescript/ ~/.claude/skills/applescript/
```

```bash
# Project-level (works with Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.)
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -r applescript/ .agents/skills/applescript/
```

### Step 2: Reference in your system prompt (if needed)

**Claude Code and Claude Desktop users can skip this step** — they auto-discover skills and do not require manual registration.

This step is only relevant for agents that don't support auto-discovery. Add the skill's name and description to your system prompt or tool catalog so the agent knows it's available:

```
Available skills:
- applescript: Automate native macOS applications using AppleScript via osascript.
  Use when users ask to interact with Reminders, Calendar, Notes, Mail, Finder,
  Notification Center, System Events, or any scriptable Mac app. Also handles
  HTML→PDF rendering (Swift + WebKit), HTML-bodied email drafts (clipboard paste
  into Mail), and fast Calendar/Reminders reads (Swift + EventKit).
```

When the agent activates the skill, it should read `applescript/SKILL.md` and follow the instructions there. The `allowed-tools` frontmatter declares the required tool permissions:

```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - Bash(osascript:*)
  - Bash(sdef:*)
  - Bash(swiftc:*)
  - Bash(swift:*)
```

Ensure your agent has permission to run these tools via Bash. `swiftc` and `swift` are required for the PDF renderer and the Swift Calendar/Reminders readers — if you don't plan to use those, you can omit them.

### Step 3: Verify it's working

Ask your agent: **"Remind me to test this in 5 minutes"**. If a reminder appears in the macOS Reminders app, the skill is installed and working correctly.

## Usage

Once installed, ask your agent to do things like:

- "Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 9am"
- "Create a calendar event for Friday at 2pm called Team Sync"
- "Show me my incomplete reminders"
- "Send a notification that the build finished"
- "Draft an email to team@example.com with this week's update"
- "Draft an **HTML** email to investors@example.com with our Q1 numbers in a styled table"
- "Generate a branded PDF report from this data and save it to ~/Desktop"

The agent reads the skill definition, generates the appropriate AppleScript (or HTML, for the rendering paths), and executes it on your Mac.

### `applescript/SKILL.md`

The core skill file. Contains:

- **Executing AppleScript** — how to run scripts via `osascript` with heredocs
- **Date formatting** — rules for AppleScript's locale-sensitive date parsing
- **Scripting guide** — pointer to syntax, error handling, and dictionary lookup reference
- **Agent workflow** — step-by-step instructions including error diagnosis and retry
- **macOS permissions table** — which apps require user approval and what to expect on first run
- **Ready-made scripts** — pre-built `.applescript` and `.swift` files the agent can run directly

### `applescript/scripts/`

Pre-built scripts the agent can run directly. AppleScript files (`.applescript`) run via `osascript`; Swift files (`.swift`) compile once with `swiftc` and run as native binaries. Both save tokens by avoiding generation for common tasks. Each script has a comment header with usage, arguments, and (for Swift) the compile command.

### `applescript/references/`

Each file contains vetted, copy-paste-ready AppleScript snippets for a specific app or topic. The agent loads only the reference files relevant to the current task — this is part of the progressive disclosure model (see below).

## How It Works: Progressive Disclosure

This skill follows the [agent skills progressive disclosure](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills) model, which loads information in three stages to minimize context window usage:

1. **Discovery** — The agent sees only the skill's `name` and `description` from the SKILL.md frontmatter (~100 tokens). This is enough for the agent to decide whether the skill is relevant to the current task.

2. **Activation** — When the agent determines the skill matches the user's request, it loads the full `SKILL.md` instructions (execution patterns, workflow, and permissions table).

3. **Execution** — As the agent works through the task, it pulls in specific reference files and scripts only when needed. This keeps detailed material out of context until it's actually required.

This means the skill costs almost nothing when it's not in use, and loads just what's needed when it is.
